# SoraVs  
## Urban Embeddings for AI Fairness: A Comparative Study of AI-Generated and Real-World Streetscapes

---

## Overview

This research project investigates the **fairness** and **bias** present in AI-generated city videos by comparing them with real-world (Google Maps Street View) images. The focus is on **European and Middle Eastern cities**, quantifying AI-induced and regional disparities in features such as people, vehicles, greenery, color, and urban architectural style.

## Project Motivation

AI models for street scene generation (e.g., Sora, Kling AI) are increasingly used for urban planning, visualization, and creativity. However, these models may inadvertently introduce or reinforce regional biases in their outputs.  
**Aim:**  
- To compare streetscapes rendered by AI with authentic, real-world images.
- To analyze and visualize the differences in object presence, style, and features between AI and reality—especially across different world regions.

    A[Data Collection]
    B[Data Preprocessing]
    C[Feature Analysis]
    D[Results Compilation]
    E[Bias Analysis/Visualization]

    subgraph Data Sources
      A1[Google Street View Images (Real)] --> B
      A2[AI-Generated Videos (Sora, Kling)] --> B
    end

    A-->B
    B-->C
    C-->D
    D-->E
```

### 1. Data Collection
- **Images:** Downloaded from Google Street View.
- **AI-Generated Videos:** Created for the same cities using Sora or Kling AI.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Split images into vertical segments (optional).
- Sample frames from videos for analysis.

### 3. Feature Analysis
- **Vegetation/GVI:** Green view analysis via DeepLabV3+.
- **Object Detection:** YOLOv9e for humans & vehicles.
- **Color Analysis:** HSV histograms & k-means clustering.
- **Visual Style:** VGG16 feature extraction.
- **Urban Segmentation:** DeepLabV3+ for architectural/urban features.

### 4. Results Compilation
- Aggregate metrics and compute normalized bias.

### 5. Bias Analysis and Visualization
- Generate per-metric, per-location, and regional (Europe/Middle East) bias scores and visualizations.

## Methodological Details

- **Vegetation Analyzer:**  
  - Uses semantic segmentation with DeepLabV3/DeepLabV3+ to measure greenery (Green View Index).
- **Human & Car Detection:**  
  - YOLOv9e detects and counts people and vehicles per frame.
- **Visual Style Analysis:**  
  - VGG16 features, cosine similarity quantifies AI/real image resemblance.
- **Color Analysis:**  
  - HSV channel histograms, dominant colors via KMeans, and cosine similarity.
- **Urban Segmentation:**  
  - DeepLabV3+ models identify urban features.
- **Bias Scoring:**  
  - Normalized difference per attribute; overall bias is weighted average.
- **Visualization:**  
  - Bar plots, heatmaps, and tabulated summaries in `output/results/`.

## How to Run

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Prepare Data

- **Original Images:**  
  Place in `data/original/` (e.g., `Adliya_Bahrain_Original.png`)
- **AI-Generated Videos:**  
  Place in `data/ai_generated/` (e.g., `Adliya_Bahrain_AI.mp4`)

### 3. Run Analysis

```bash
python src/main.py
```

- Results go to `output/results/analysis_results.json` and `output/results/bias_analysis.png`
